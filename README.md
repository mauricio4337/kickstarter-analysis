## Recommendations
Louise would be most likely to complete a successful Kickstarter campaign for a play in the US if she starts her play in early spring, she has a funding goal of up to $5,000 (the upperquartile of successful campaigns).  Louise should avoid campaigns that ask for more than $10,250 as successful campaigns above this amount likely had exceptional factors that contributed to their success.  Suggested donations above and below the mean donation should be listed in the campaign (i.e. funding levels of $25, $75, $125, $250)
